# Code of Merit

1. The project creators, lead developers, core team, constitute
the managing members of the project and have final say in every decision
of the project, technical or otherwise, including overruling previous decisions.

2. The managing members' decisions regarding acceptance or rejection of 
contributions must be communicated in sufficient technical detail and,
where appropriate,  in the context of the project's values and circumstances. If 
this communication can't be immediate,  managing members should ensure that 
it occurs within a reasonable amount of time.

3. The managing members' decisions are immutable and immune to challenges 
or appeals.

4. Contributions are an expected result of project membership.Contributors 
must not expect others to do their work for them or constantly help them 
with their work. 

5. Contributions should only be rejected if they fail to address the project's technical 
needs or quality standards, or if they fail to match the project's values and/or 
circumstances.

6. All project members have the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want
within the project. 

7. Authority or position in the project will be proportional
to the accrued contribution. Seniority must be earned.

8. Software is evolutive: the better implementations must supersede lesser
implementations. Technical advantage is the primary evaluation metric.

9. This is a space for technical prowess; topics outside of the project
will not be tolerated.

10. Non technical conflicts will be discussed in a separate space. Disruption
of the project will not be allowed.

11. Individual project members' characteristics, including but not limited to,
body, sex, sexual preference, race, language, religion, nationality,
or political preferences are irrelevant in the scope of the project and
will not be taken into account concerning members' value or that of their contribution
to the project.

12. Discuss or debate the idea, not the person.

13. There is no room for ambiguity: Ambiguity will be met with questioning;
further ambiguity will be met with silence. It is the responsibility
of the originator to provide requested context.

14. If something is illegal outside the scope of the project, it is illegal
in the scope of the project. This Code of Merit does not take precedence over
governing law.

15. This Code of Merit governs the technical procedures of the project not the 
activities outside of it. 

16. Participation on the project equates to agreement of this Code of Merit.

17. No objectives beyond the stated objectives of this project are relevant
to the project. Any intent to deviate the project from its original purpose
of existence will constitute grounds for remedial action which may include
expulsion from the project.
